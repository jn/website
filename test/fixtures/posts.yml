      <div id="post-body"><p class="p1">I've been learning, although sometimes a little bit randomly, over the past few weeks. I'm curious if the course content in class, which is largely obvious or review, is taking a lot of my "thought time" (how much I'm able to mentally process in a day before becoming tired). I find my yearning for more, wanting to improve, but sometimes its as if I'm too tired to make that jump. Let's see if I can work on that for next week's post.</p><p class="p1"><b><br></b></p><p class="p1"><b>Jan 18</b></p>
      <p class="p1">There’s a second smaller canyon in the area of the Grand Canyon, as well as a cool ghost town. (I’m being liberal and saying 4 hour driving radius is within the area).</p>

      <p class="p1">Sentiment Analysis is a type of machine learning / AI that can analyze a text and “assign” an emotion to it (think happy, sad etc). By analyzing the content, especially in the context of the other words (intratexuality if you will), we can easily determine the meaning behind words.</p>
      <p class="p1"><b>Jan 23</b></p>
      <p class="p1">Quick conversations can often lead you down a completely different path in whatever you are working on, sometimes for the better and sometimes for worse. If you are researching, remember that risk aversion may negatively affect you.</p>

      <p class="p1">Reorganizing and cleaning can be a good stress reliever and really help you later on.&nbsp;</p>
